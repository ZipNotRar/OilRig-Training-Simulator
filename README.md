# OilRig-Training-Simulator
## The files presented here show the logic behind production of the Virtual Reality training simulator "OilRig Training Simulator":-

* The [**GestureDetector script**](GestureDetector.cs) does this this this.
* The [**JoyStickControl script**](JoystickControl.cs) does this this this.
* Finally, the [**SwimMovement.cs script**](SwimMovement.cs) lets the patient "swim" when they are underwater within the game.
* Finally, the [**audioScript.cs script**](audioScript.cs) is responsible for providing the background music when being underwater.
* Finally, the [**mirrorHand.cs script**](mirrorHand.cs) is responsible for mirroring the position and rotation of the patient's controller "hand" in the game.
* Finally, the [**swimmer.cs script**](swimmer.cs) is responsible for creating an underwater fog effect at the very moment of patient going underwater.

### Additionally, there are 2 Videoclips which will give you a run-through of what to expect in the game and the internal sections of each script.
